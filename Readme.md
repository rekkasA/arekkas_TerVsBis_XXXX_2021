**Background**: Bisphosphonates are first-line treatments to prevent osteoporotic fractures. Teriparatide has been recently shown to be more effective in a head-to-head RCT and is currently used for more severe cases.

**Objectives**: To study the comparative effectiveness of teriparatide vs bisphosphonates to reduce hip fracture risk. In addition, we stratified by predicted risk to assess treatment effect heterogeneity.
